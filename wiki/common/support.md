Dear enthusiast 

If you are on this page, it means that you are interested in a special part of my project. Looking for documentation, a special implementation, or adding a new feature to the driver? If so, you are in the right place. What you are looking for is currently not ready and is waiting for your support and donation. Behind every toy of this project, there is a lot of research, designing, testing... If you want to move and you don't have time to develop it yourself, write to my email and explain to me what you need to add to the project. Simple support is to add a ![/python_test_script/display/images/star.png](https://github.com/mamin27/ecomet_i2c_raspberry_tools/blob/master/python_test_scripts/display/images/star.png) to my GitHub project. If you need more, there is a way to donate my work  and I will add your request to the project.
